# R Programming for Data Manipulation and Random Statistical Computation

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Assignment 1 (2021)

This assignment covered quantitative R programming for data manipulation, aggregation, and statistical computation. Tasks included CSV processing, conditional sums, random vector/list creation, matrix operations, and loop-based calculations.

## Key Tasks
- Loaded and aggregated expenditure data with filters  
- Created lists with random normal vectors (set.seed)  
- Built matrices and computed column sums using loops  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R programming: data frames, lists, matrices, loops  
- Random number generation and statistical computation  
- Quantitative data manipulation and validation
